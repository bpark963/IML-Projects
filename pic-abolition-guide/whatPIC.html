    <h2 class="pic-title">WHAT IS THE PIC?</h2>
    <h4 class="pic-definition">
      The <span class="red-text">Prison Industrial Complex (PIC)</span> is a
      term used to describe overlapping that use tools such as policing,
      imprisonment, criminalization, and surveillance as solutions to economic,
      social, and political problems.
    </h4>
    <div class="pic-body">
      <p class="pic-body-text">
        Through its reach and impact, the PIC helps and
        <b>maintains the authority of people </b> who get their power through
        racial, economic and other privileges.
      </p>
      <p class="pic-body-text">
        There are many ways this power is collected and maintained through the
        PIC, including creating mass media images which keep alive stereotypes
        of people of color, poor people, queer people, immigrants, youth, and
        other <b>oppressed communities as criminal, delinquent, or deviant.</b>
      </p>
      <p class="pic-body-text">
        This power is also maintained by earning huge profits for private
        companies that deal with prisons and police forces; helping earn
        political gains for “tough on crime” politicians; increasing the
        influence of prison guard and police unions; and eliminating social and
        political dissent by
        <b
          >oppressed communities that make demands for self-determination and
          reorganization of power in the US.</b
