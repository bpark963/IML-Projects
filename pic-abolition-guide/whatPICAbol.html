      WHAT IS PIC ABOLITION?
    </h2>
    <h4 class="abol-definition">
      <span class="red-text">PIC Abolition</span> is a political vision with the goal of eliminating imprisonment, policing, and surveillance and creating lasting alternatives to punishment and imprisonment.
    </h4>
    <div class="abol-body">
      <p class="abol-body-text">
        Abolition isn’t just about getting rid of buildings full of cages. It’s also about <b>undoing the society we live in</b> because the PIC both feeds on and maintains oppression and inequalities through punishment, violence, and controls millions of people.
      </p>
      <p class="abol-body-text">
        An abolitionist vision means that we must build models today that can represent <b> how we want to live in the future.</b>
      </p>
      <p class="abol-body-text">
        It means developing practical strategies for taking small steps that move us toward making our dreams real, and that lead us all to believe that things really could be different. It means living this vision in our daily lives.
