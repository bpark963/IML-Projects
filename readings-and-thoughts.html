    <h1>Readings and Thoughts</h1>
    <h2>Week 1: Cataloguing Change: Women, Art and Technology</h2>
    <p>
      “Cataloguing Change: Women, Art and Technology” discusses critical
      contributions that women made in creating, curating, and teaching new
      media and computer art. The article begins with early conceptions of
      digital art through artists such as Molnar, who used the computer directly
      to “generate visual possibilities.” The article particularly highlights
      Bell Laboratories as an influential actor, assisting artists such as
      Schwartz in experimenting with computers and helping her create one of the
      first computer-generated motion-graphic films. In describing women's
      history in computer art, the article further discusses the complex
      relationship between gender and technology. The development of computer
      science in male-dominated environments made it difficult for female
      artists to navigate the uneasy gender dynamics of the technology.
      Technology is not an objective product but a cultural artifact that is
      given meaning, resulting in its embodiment of patriarchal values. In both
      past and present, women have been vital contributors to computer art, a
      fact that contemporary art networks have been continually addressing.

    <p>
      <b>Qs:</b><br />
      1. Is technology bias-free? How does bias play a role in shaping
      technologies we use daily? <br />2. How does AI-generated art impact
      creative freedom and originality? <br />3. Will certain mediums be
      impossible for technology to have an impact on?
    </p>

    <h2>Week 2: American Artist, Black Gooey Universe</h2>
    <p>
      “Black Gooey Universe” discusses the development of the graphical user
      interface (GUI) and its inseparable relationship with race. Even before
      the technology’s inception, Silicon Valley startup culture started as a
      space of whiteness, one where straight cis white males developed ideas
      without consequence in their “ivory tower.” This embedded whiteness is
      reflected in technology itself, highlighted in XeroxPARC’s first rendition
      of a black native screen GUI, which was later turned white when Apple
      appropriated the GUI into the Apple Lisa. As technology becomes more
      ubiquitous, it becomes harder to view it critically and recognize these
      hegemonic systems within them. </p>
      
      <p>In response, Artist proposes Blackness as
      an antithesis to screens’ assumed whiteness of screens. In LCD monitors,
      blackness is the default: it is from this blackness that colors were
      represented, which is why Apple had to create an inefficient white
      backdrop for the Lisa. The Black gooey (GUI) can seem slow or broken when
      the values of white screens are prevalent, but its nuance gives it the
      power to “destroy a contemporary hegemonic interface.”
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Qs:</b><br />
      1. How is hegemony maintained through technology? Why does technology seem
      “objective”? <br />2. In addition to technological systems, how does
      racial injustice affect technology distribution? <br />3. Other than the
      GUI, what other technological spaces do we see whiteness embedded within
      them?
    </p>

    <h2>Week 3: How to Internet</h2>
    <p>
      When thinking about the Internet, computers, and how I utilized them in my
      childhood, there’s a weird grey space that I cannot remember past. One of
      my earliest memories of using computers was playing CD video games my
      parents would get and learning how to type and make PowerPoint
      presentations at school. The transition from using computers less than 1-2
      hours a day to god knows how many hours I am on the Internet now is hard
      to imagine, which calls into question the ubiquity and naturalization of
      Internet culture that spread so quickly. </p>
    <p>A section of Odell’s article that
      resonated with me was ‘how-to’ videos and their transition to ‘sponsored
      how-to’ videos. In my early teenage years, I grew up and learned a lot
      from these homemade, low-quality ‘how-to’ videos - whether it be game
      tutorials, magic tricks, or even school work. Nowadays, such videos have
      evolved to what Odell describes as “hyper-produced” videos, where “every
      day” content creators centralize their videos around sponsored products,
      affiliated links, and Amazon storefronts.</p> 
    <p>Imagining the Internet as an
      innocent communicative space is hard, especially when the anonymity it
      provides can heighten hate speech - misogynist trolls and racist
      subreddits, as Odell mentions. However, when there seem to be fewer
      chances to establish connections with people around the world due to the
      commodified and productivity-focused state of the Internet, thinking back
      on how the Internet used to be can be a good refresher on its potential
      and help us critically think about its development.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Qs:</b><br />
      1. When is the last time you had an unmediated conversation with someone
      on the Internet? Of course, all communication on the Internet is mediated,
      but when was the last time you had a truly random encounter with someone?
      <br />2. Do you think it’s possible for the Internet to change into a
      space with more “randomness” and chance conversations with strangers? Why
      or why not? <br />3. In Odell’s example with Roosh, she explains that it’s
      hard to find a “sense of mutual understanding” or “coexistence on the same
      plane of reality” when conversing with strangers on the Internet. What
      structures may be reinforcing this pattern and behavior?
    </p>

    <h2>Week 5: Feeling at Home</h2>
    <p>
      Lauren McCarthy’s talk at Eyeo 2019 helped me bridge a gap in my
      understanding of surveillance. I have always viewed and understood
      surveillance as a form of explicit and implicit control through equipment
      like surveillance, body, and home cameras, but I had never thought to
      think of social media as a form of surveillance. Just like McCarthy’s
      ‘Follower,’ we are essentially signing up to be followed and surveilled
      when we sign up and post on social media. From this perspective, as
      McCarthy states, surveillance becomes a luxury experience. It stems from a
      desire to be seen, and those in privileged positions are able to fulfil
      that desire by expressing that there is nothing to hide about them. On the
      other hand, surveillance takes on a different meaning for those within
      oppressed communities. It becomes a tool that works against them, used for
      profiling, policing, and control. Another important idea that I resonated
      with is McCarthy’s explanation that there is a complex but close
      connection between human labor and how an AI system like Amazon Alexa
      works. Because we seldom have human-to-human interaction on the Internet
      or through technological systems – as explored by Odell’s “How to
      Internet” article – we seem to also forget that humans are the ones
      creating and managing these systems. Technology like Amazon Alexa does not
      come into existence out of anywhere; it is created within a small
      homogenous group of developers where multiple instances of bias and error
      can be found. With the exponential development of AI systems like ChatGPT
      and DALL-E 2, this disconnect may be exacerbated.
    </p>

      <p>
        <b>Qs:</b>
        <br />1. What are we losing/sacrificing for the sake of convenience when
      we use AI systems like Alexa? <br />2. Where does the ‘desire to be seen,’
      as McCarthy talks about, stem from? <br />3. How has the disconnect
      between technology and the human labor behind it affected issues regarding
      accountability? Will this further shift with the continued development of
      AI systems?
    </p>

    <h2>Week 6: In Defense of the Poor Image</h2>
    <p>
      Low-resolution images or “poor images” are often regarded as useless,
      inferior versions of high-quality images. When you can search multiple
      versions of the same image in a matter of seconds, they may seem
      unnecessary; why search and use low-resolution images when you can search
      and use high-quality alternatives? However, poor images are not just
      degraded versions of their higher-quality counterparts; they have their
      own unique cultural and political significance. The commercialization of
      cinema and the expansion of audiovisual monopolies have allowed the
      hegemonic ideology of global capitalism to maintain its power; the
      commercial circulation of high-quality images leaves no room for
      imperfections. Poor images, in this sense, are a counter-hegemonic,
      nonconformist force that resists this force. Poor images are often
      produced by and for marginalized communities with outdated cameras,
      computers, or other unconventional forms of distribution that we may find
      inefficient now. This communal participation in the production of images
      allows these marginalized communities to create networks and share
      information in the face of censorship and repression in the form of
      privatization and privacy. Poor images embrace their imperfections and
      instead use them as an opportunity to view images outside of a consumerist
      perspective. It escapes the concept of viewing culture as a commodity and
      rather views it as a collaborative practice where everyone is both the
      viewer and the producer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>Qs:</b>
      <br />1. How can artists reclaim creativity in an age where art is
      commodified? <br />2. Is there such a thing as an “original image”? How
      might the notion of an “original image” differ in terms of digital
      culture? <br />3. How are “poor images” being reproduced now? What are
      some attempts at repressing these “poor images”?
    </p>
    
    <h2>Week 7: How I’m Fighting Bias in Algorithms</h2>
    <p>
      As technology is often viewed as a static object that cannot be affected
      by social and political structures, we tend to detach ourselves from the
      human labor that went behind creating the technology. We tend to think of
      modern technology as something invented when a genius just someday thinks
      of it. However, many factors, such as marketing, media representations,
      and human subjectivity when creating technology, all influence how we
      perceive and use it. One aspect that stood out to me the most from
      Buolamwini talk was when she mentioned the real-life implications of
      algorithmic bias. The vast dataset on which facial recognition is based is
      built on systems of inequality; Being mislabelled as someone else on a
      Facebook post, as Buolamwini mentions, or on your iPhone Photos app seems
      harmless, but that same technology is used to perpetuate real-life harm.
      For example, studies have repeatedly shown that marginalized communities –
      particularly poor, Black and brown communities – are more heavily policed
      than their counterparts. Thus, when facial recognition technology is used
      for predictive policing, it disproportionately affects these communities
      with increased surveillance, policing, and false accusation rates. As
      facial recognition technology continues to build on surveillance data
      within these communities, the coded bias within them grows exponentially,
      ultimately creating a positive loop that exacerbates such social
      consequences through time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>Qs:</b>
      <br />1. How can we resist algorithmic bias? <br />2. How do we call for
      accountability for the harm caused by AI/machine learning technology?
      <br />3. Is there a type/piece of technology that equally benefits all? In
      what ways do the technology we use daily for our benefit harm others?
    </p>
    
    <h2>Week 11: Omni-Specialized Design for Beautiful Futures</h2>
    <p>
      One part of Ari Melenciano’s talk that particularly interested me was her
      discussion on how our general understanding of design stems from
      industrialization and capitalism, which are structurally supported by
      humanism, colonialism, and racism. Design choices across all fields of it,
      from industrial to user interface, are often motivated by what makes the
      most profit or generates the most “efficient” work. For example, as we
      have read from “How to Internet” back in week 3, the internet was filled
      with much more connection, creativity, freedom, and variety in its
      inception. Now, most websites we access seem to stem from a single
      template; there needs to be a hero section with a tagline to grab
      attention, a piece of text about business value…etc. From a blank canvas
      of infinite connection possibilities, the web quickly turned into a
      commercial and business space as advertisement spaces started to take
      over. In “The Role of Mass Media in U.S. Imperialism,” scholar Robert
      Chrisman discusses how even the most distinguished creative talent in the
      United States is not used for creativity’s sake or social change but to
      “create advertisement jingles and images.” What does it mean for
      creativity when it is being used to drive sales and increase productivity?
      When words like “human-centered design” are being thrown around with
      little to no meaning? We must be critical of the fact that the development
      of design itself has been inherently exclusionary and based on systems of
      oppression, and use Omni-Specialized Design to deconstruct and unlearn the
      design of the past.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>Qs:</b>
      <br />1. How do we start imagining better futures (futures without systems
      of oppression), and what forces exist that prevent us from doing so?
      <br />2. How can creativity be used for social change? What events in the
      past have shown so? <br />3. What can we, as university students, do to
      start practicing ecologically-centered design?
    </p>
    
    <h2>Week 12: The Enchanting Music of Sign Language</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout Christine Sun Kim’s talk, I really enjoyed the connections that
      she drew between ASL and language as a whole to music. I think her points
      on language and music can be extended further to communication as a whole.
      As she mentions early in the talk, a musical note cannot be fully
      expressed on paper. Even with the many notations and articulations with
      their own meanings, sometimes written in full sentences like “Play cute
      yet frightening,” there is no way to completely translate what a composer
      had in their head to another person. Just as each interpreter gives Kim a
      unique voice and identity, one conductor may interpret a piece of music
      completely differently than another, even when all the written notations
      are the same. This ability/inability to communicate an idea, thought, or
      feeling exactly to another person stands true for whatever medium it may
      be. For example, the concept of ‘정' in Korean is difficult to explain in
      English, even when using multiple sentences. Does that mean the concept or
      the feeling of ‘정' does not exist? Even within the same language, this
      stands true. If you cannot describe what you felt after seeing a movie in
      words, does that mean your feeling is false?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Qs:</b>
      <br />1. What are some ways we communicate, excluding written words and
      sounds? How can they be notated and expressed to convey the same original
      meaning? <br />2. Do you think the arts, or any type of creative
      expression, has the ability to communicate in ways that traditional
      languages can’t? <br />3. Are there ways to translate visual works to
      auditory sounds and vice versa? Are there ways to translate audio-visual
      works to tactile sensations?
