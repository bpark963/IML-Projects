      <p>
        안녕! My name is <b>Brian (Hyunje) Park</b> and I'm currently a second year Master's student at NYU's 
        <b>Media, Culture, and Communication</b> program. This website is an archive of exercises and projects developed
        during USC's Spring 2023 <i>IML300: Reading and Writing the Web</i> under the instruction of Professor Q. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I've always had a fascination with <b>creative web projects</b>, and I'm
        glad I had the opportunity to expand my artistic practice durinig this particular semester.
        Thanks for coming by!

      <h2>Project 1: Interactive Audio & Visual with p5.js</h2>
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/bpark963/sketches/sE51tfeiM"
        >3D Audio-Visualizer</a
      >
      <p>
        What does sound look like? Such a question might seem nonsensical as it
        might feel the same as asking what smell a certain color has. Looking at
        waveforms, however, gives a clear answer to the question. As sounds are
        longitudinal waves that travel through the air, there is always a way in
        which we can visualize them. If you spread sand or pour water on top of
        a speaker, beautiful patterns based on sound waves appear depending on
        the sound you play. But how can we imagine sound in shapes and forms
        we've never seen before? By utilizing WebGL, this project visualizes
        sounds in various spherical forms which the user can manipulate. From
        regular spheres to bumpy ones, this visualizer helps reveal beautiful
        patterns that lie in sound.

      <h2>Project 2: HyperNarrative</h2>
      <a

        What do you Fear Concept Brainstorm</a
      ><br />
      <a href="what-do-you-fear/index.html">What do you Fear</a>
      <p>
        What do we fear? When we were younger, we used to fear the imaginary; we
        had to run back to our rooms when turning off the living room lights,
        and there most definitely was a monster in the closet/under the bed.
        However, as adults, we like to believe we no longer fear those things.
        But do these “old” fears really go away? What happens when you do
        escape, for a brief moment, from these childhood fears? Do you feel
        safe? If 'You' manage to run away successfully from the figure - the
        childhood fears - there are only other more "real" fears that come to
        light: The fear of the future, the worry of having to work tirelessly
        for years to come in a system where you are disconnected from your work.

      <h2>Project 3: Networked Justice</h2>
      <a

      <a href="pic-abolition-guide/index.html"
        >PIC Abolition Tutorial.</a
      >
      <p>
        PIC Abolition Tutorial is a web project created to introduce the concept
        of the Prison Industrial Complex (PIC) and the PIC Abolition movement to
        those unfamiliar with them. As the PIC is a broad, complex issue, this
        website does not hold all relevant information about it, how to resist
        against it, and answers to all possible questions. Likewise, the PIC
        Abolition movement has a long history that cannot be fully encapsulated
        in a short web project. However, this project serves the important
        purpose of standing as a starting point to help people imagine
        alternatives to the retributive justice system in which most of the
        world functions under.
